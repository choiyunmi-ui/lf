								<dd>“The only golf point that never existed in the world!” LF POINT is a new golf point system that evaluates players by applying an objective standard that is similar to the KLPGA official records, and scores would then be calculated accordingly. In 2013, LF POINT started off with SBS Golf and has since challenged female Korean golfers. The top eight players play in the LF POINT Queen of Queens Match after the end of the season to fight for the title of “golf empress.” <br><a href="http://www.lfpoint.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lfpoint.com/</a></dd>

								<dd>Lafuma, in cooperation with the Korean Alpine Club, is running the “Say Hello in the Mountains” campaign as the first part of its long-term project to instill a hiking culture in Korea. The “Namaste! Say Hello in the Mountains” campaign by Lafuma was conceived by observing Himalayan trekkers who would often say “Namaste” to each other. Lafuma hopes to build on the campaign and have hikers exchange simple greetings, such as “hello,” “nice to meet you,” and “stay health.” Anyone hiking in the mountains can voluntarily be part of the campaign. The program does not coerce or attract participants by giving benefits. Rather, the program hopes to naturally instill this culture in Korea.</dd>

								<dd>Lafuma has co-established a radio station with MBC and KOICA under the slogan, “the most beautiful broadcasting station in the world” in Jomsom, located at an altitude of 3,000 m above sea level, the Himalayas, Nepal.<br>
									The only road connected to the outside world is the way to Muktinath, a sacred Hindu place. Nonetheless, the area is in a dire situation where power failure occurs every day. What the people in Jomsom would die for is nothing but information.<br>
									“The most beautiful broadcasting station in the world” will not only become the central hub of information for Jomsom people but will also be used as a disaster relief tool for trekkers who climb Annapurna.</dd>
